Degree distribution models are essential tools for assessing and understanding the form and nature of social networks, and they can also be helpful for the development of efficient graph algorithms. We will compare multiple distributions and look at each parameter's likelihood and number of parameters to identify a distribution that suits the data in this project.
The goal is to figure out if all of these languages have the same kind of word link distribution and have the same distribution parameters.
We'll be working on out-degree distributions for ten different languages and consider several different degree distributions listed below.
- Poisson distribution
- Geometric distribution
- Zeta distribution
- Zeta distribution with $\gamma=2$
- Right truncated distribution
